=======

A Python library of Practically Scalable Shared Objects.
It currently support Apache Cassandra.
The objects implemented in the library are: 
compare-and-swap,
spinlock,
stack,
mapping,
consensus
and a few esoteric objects which are necessary to build the above objects.

To sidestep the consensus/CAP impossibility result, all the objects in the library are obstruction-free, that is a call might take a lot of time in case the contention is high. It is nevertheless possible to add some helping mechanisms or to proxy all the accesses through a leader (as in Paxos). 

For additional details, a paper is available in bib/paper.pdf.
