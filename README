A Python library of Practically Scalable Shared Objects.
It currently support Apache Cassandra.
The objects implemented in the library are: 
compare-and-swap,
spinlock,
stack,
mapping,
consensus
and a few esoteric objects which are necessary to build the above objects.

To sidestep the consensus/CAP impossibility result, all the objects in the library are obstruction-free, 
that is a call might take a lot of time in case the contention is high.
It is nevertheless possible to add some helping mechanisms or to proxy all the accesses
through a leader (à la Paxos). 

For additional details, a paper is available at the following address on arxiv http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2772.
